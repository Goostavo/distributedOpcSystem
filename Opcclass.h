// Simple OPC Client Class
//
// This is a modified version of the "Simple OPC Client" originally
// developed by Philippe Gras (CERN) and further enhanced by Luiz T. S.
// Mendes (UFMG).
//
// The code, previously monolitic was edited with the objective to be 
// fully encapsulated inside a class.
// The public functions are based in objective of use instead of being
// based in the main OPC COM functions.
